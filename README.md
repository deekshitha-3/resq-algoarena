# ResQ 🚨 – AI-Powered Disaster Detection & Response System

**ResQ** is an end-to-end AI-powered system that detects floods and wildfires in real-time using satellite and drone imagery, and connects disaster victims to rescue teams through a user-friendly web application.

Built with a mission to save lives by reducing response times, ResQ integrates **Machine Learning models** and **a Web App interface** — ensuring help reaches victims faster, smarter, and when it’s needed the most.

## 🚀 Features

### ML Model
- **Flood Detection Model:** Processes real-time satellite imagery (Sentinel-1 SAR & NOAA-20 VIIRS) to identify flood-affected areas with 92%+ accuracy.
- **Victim Detection Model:** Detects humans and animals in satellite or drone images and flags high-risk zones for prioritized rescue operations.

### Web Application
- **SOS Button:** Victims can send a distress signal instantly by pressing a single button.
- **Live Location Capture:** Captures user's live location and checks for disaster presence via satellite mapping.
- **Instant Alerting:** Automatically notifies NGOs, rescue teams, and authorities.
- **Community Posts:** Generates a live post with location and situation to help volunteers and communities act faster.
- **Shelter Mapping:** Displays nearest shelters and safe zones based on the detected disaster.
- **Rescue Tracking:** Victims can track the approaching rescue teams through animated map paths.
